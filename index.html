          My name is Jonathan. I was born and raised in Colorado. It was there at Western State College that I met my wife. In 2011 we moved to Washington state to pursue new adventures and experiences. Washington has been a great launching point for our pursuits, which include alot of travel. We have driven the length of the USA (coast to coast baby!). We have also traveled to Costa Rica and New Zealand.

          Shortly after moving to Washington I pursed a career in distilled spirits. I wanted learn everything there was to know about whiskey. WWhile I started selling and curating a whiskey collection I ultimately desired to make it myself. That lead me to Whidbey Island Distillery. Despite my having a communications degree and no chemical engineering degree, the owners recognized my passion and took a chance on me. I have been there for the last 5 years learning whiskey from start to finish, from grain to bottle.
