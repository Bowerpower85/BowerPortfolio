A bio website for Jonathan Bower. It was created to allow the owner to showcase their unique qualities and to share some of the great projects he is working on.The site is reactive so it should look good on a multitude of different sized screens. As the owner adds more to his portfolio then those pages can be updated. If the owner decides they want to engage their customers more then updates will need to be done because the contact information is not currently stored in a database. The bio page can be updated when the owner gives imput on more specific content they want in their bio. 
Bootstrap was leveraged throughout the website to provide some structure and style. Most of it was used in the h1 using Jumbotron and a navbar. The contact page was inspired by Darkcode youtube channel, https://youtu.be/f0DcnrpeBv8.
